And we roll on to another month. Major changes here is the $20k RRSP loan we took
out with the bank.  We used it so I could contribute $12k to a spousal RRSP and
add $8K into my RRSP account. 

We decided to take out the loans this year because we were debt free. This is
the first year my wife and I are actively starting to invest into our retirement
and didn't want to miss out deferring some of my income taxes. I'm hoping to
dive more into my income in a future blog post, but the main point is my
marginal tax rate is currently 47.97% (for 2017).

We've also started tracking out credit card spending, which should help to give a
metric on our spending habits each month.

Here are the numbers:

**Assets: $291,502 (+11.75%)**

* Cash: $6,204 (-29.59%)
* Savings: $6,485 (+0.00%)
* Registered/Retirement Investment Accounts (RRSP): $82,533 (+37.01%)
* Tax Free Savings Accounts (TFSA): $0 (+0.00%)
* Non-Registered Investment Accounts: $21,279 (+21.15%)
* Principal Residence: $175,000 (+0.00%)

**Liabilities: $126,510 (+18.73%)**

* Principal Residence Mortgage: $106,065 (-0.04%)
* Spousal RSP Loan: $10,630 (-12.88%)
* RSP Loan: $7,395 (-8.18%)
* Credit Cards: $2,418 (+0.00%)

**Total Net Worth: $164,991 (+6.93%)**
