It's time for me to start tracking our net worth! The current format is heavily
inspired from the [Million Dollar Journey][1] but I expect it to change over
time.

Here are the numbers:

**Assets: $260,841**

* Cash: $8,040
* Registered/Retirement Investment Accounts (RRSP): $60,237
* Tax Free Savings Accounts (TFSA): $0
* Non-Registered Investment Accounts: $17,564
* Principal Residence: $175,000

**Liabilities: $106,547**

* Principal Residence Mortgage: $106,547

**Total Net Worth: $154,294**

I've been tracking our net worth for a while, but this is the first time I've
included our principal residence in the calculation. So the current value of the
total net worth is a little surprising to me.

Going forward, I plan to break down each section a little more, better
explaining how the data changed over the month.
